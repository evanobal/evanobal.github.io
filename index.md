## Welcome to Evan Obal's ePortfolio!

I am Evan Obal, a student pursuing a major in Cybersecurity at DePaul Univerity. I am very interested in my major, I have participated in multiple Cybersecurity competitions and have worked on security related projects with both DePaul University and independently. I am a part of DePaul University's Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition team and I intern as a Security Analyst for Secure Community Network. I love to use my critical thinking skills and learning about Cybersecurity.

Here you will find various resources about my career and work that I have done.

### Projects

Here are the latest things I have been working on:

[CORE Grant Research Project](https://github.com/evanobal/evanobal.github.io/blob/master/CORE%20Admin%20-%20Report.docx) <br>
  CORE was a grant research project I assisted in developing in coordination with DePaul University and a fellow student. We created a Cybersecurity competition application to integrate into Chicago Public High Schools to get students interested in Cybersecurity. I learned and taught myself a lot during the development of this application and it has been a great experience to be apart of the project.

[Windows Security Checklist](https://github.com/evanobal/evanobal.github.io/blob/master/Evan%20Obal%20Windows%20CCDC%20Checklist.docx) <br>
   I commit a lot of time outside of class to the practice with my team for the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC). CCDC is an intensive Cybersecurity competition that takes place throughtout the year where teams composed of University students compete and test their Cybersecurity skills. The competition environment is very stressful and chaotic. One strategy we use is creating a checklist of what to do when the competition starts. This checklist is composed of steps to harden the security of your server and contains a vast amount of information helpful to the user.

[DB Cooper Digital Forensic Report](https://github.com/evanobal/evanobal.github.io/blob/master/Evan%20Obal%20-%20DePaul%20DB%20Cooper%20Report.docx) <br>
  One of my favorite classes at DePaul was Digital Forensic and Incident Response. The final project involved forensically dissecting a hard drive that supposedly belonged to the famous airplanejacker D.B. Cooper. The final project really tested my knowledge about Information Technology and made me fully understand the tools I was using to gather information about D.B. Cooper. Forensics is a topic in Security that I am interested in and knowledgable about because of this course.
