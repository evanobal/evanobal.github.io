## Welcome to Evan Obal's ePortfolio!

I am Evan Obal, a student pursuing a major in Cybersecurity at DePaul Univerity. I am very interested in my major, I have participated in multiple Cybersecurity competitions and have worked on security related projects with both DePaul University and independently. I am a part of DePaul University's Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition team and I intern as a Security Analyst for Secure Community Network. I love to use my critical thinking skills and learning about Cybersecurity.

Here you will find various resources about my career and work that I have done.
